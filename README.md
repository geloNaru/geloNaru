# Hello, World! I'm Manolito Angelo S. Munar! 👋

# Welcome to my school account 🎒
I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student from STI College in the beautiful Philippines 🇵🇭. I'm passionate about web development, and I'm currently honing my skills in JavaScript, React.js, Microsoft Server SQL, Figma, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. 
Currently, I'm diving into the world of mobile development with React Native for my thesis and potentially future projects!

I'm actively looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and learn from industry professionals. I believe that real-world experience is invaluable in nurturing my growth as a developer.

While I'm not studying or coding, I'm working on my online portfolio which will showcase my projects and skills. It's still under construction, but stay tuned!
